# HolaFly Android Developer Test

### Demo ðŸ“²



### Technical overview ðŸ› 

- Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM): It is a software architecture pattern that facilitates the separation of development from the graphical user interface (without using DataBinding). Also, there are screen states to handle the different states in the user interface.
- Coroutines: A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use in Android to simplify code that runs asynchronously.
- Android Architecture Components: Collection of libraries that help design robust, testable, and maintainable applications.
- Navigation: This component helps to implement navigation.
- ViewModel: Stores data related to the user interface that is not destroyed by changes to the user interface.
- Unit Tests with JUnit4 and Mockito: JUnit is the most popular Java testing framework. Although its name suggests that it focuses on unit tests, it actually allows you to implement any type of automated test.
